     <h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
      <p id="special">Dragon Ball Z follows the adventures of the adult Goku who, along with his companions, defends the earth against an assortment of villains ranging from intergalactic space fighters and conquerors, unnaturally powerful androids and near indestructible magical creatures. While the original Dragon Ball anime followed Goku through childhood into adulthood, Dragon Ball Z is a continuation of his adulthood life, but at the same time parallels the maturation of his son, Gohan, as well as other characters from Dragon Ball and more. The separation between the series is also significant as the latter series takes on a more dramatic and serious tone. The anime also features characters, situations and back-stories not present in the original manga.</p>

    <h4>Goku</h4>
    <p><em>Son Goku</em>, born Kakarot, is the main protagonist of the Dragon Ball metaseries. Goku is a Saiyan originally sent to destroy Earth as an infant. However, a head injury at an early age alters his memory, ridding him of his initial destructive nature and allowing him to grow up to become one of Earth's greatest defenders. He constantly strives and trains to be the greatest warrior possible, which has kept the Earth and the universe safe from destruction many times</p>
  </div>
  <div class="box">
     <h4>Vegeta</h4>
     <p><em>Vegeta</em>, recognized as Prince Vegeta is the prince of the fallen Saiyan race and one of the main characters of the Dragon Ball series.
 Regal, egotistical, and full of pride, Vegeta was once a ruthless, cold-blooded warrior and outright killer, but later abandons his role in the Frieza Force, instead opting to remain and live on Earth. His character evolves from villain, to anti-hero, then to hero through the course of the series, repeatedly fighting alongside the universe's most powerful warriors in order to protect his new home and surpass Goku in power.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="box">
    <h4>Gohan</h4>
    <p><em>Gohan</em> is a half-breed Saiyan and one of the most prominent characters in the Dragon Ball series. He is the elder son of the series' primary protagonist Goku and his wife Chi-Chi, the older brother of Goten, the husband of Videl and father to Pan. He is named after Goku's adoptive grandfather, Gohan.
Unlike his father, Gohan lacks a passion for fighting (although, he does possess a strong power within him) and prefers to do so only when his loved ones are threatened.  Nevertheless, Gohan fights alongside the Dragon Team in the defense of Earth for much of his life.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="box">
    <h4>Piccolo</h4>
    <p><em>Piccolo</em> usually just called Piccolo and also known as Mayunia, is a Namekian and also the final child and reincarnation of King Piccolo, later becoming the reunification of the Nameless Namekian after fusing with Kami. According to Grand Elder Guru, Piccolo, along with Kami and King Piccolo, are part of the Dragon Clan, who were the original creators of the Dragon Balls.
A wise and cunning warrior, he was the main antagonist in the final saga of Dragon Ball, the Piccolo Jr. Saga, and was thus a ruthless enemy of Goku. However, starting with the first saga of Dragon Ball Z, the Raditz Saga, he began to lose all villainous traits, and when he started training Goku's son Gohan during the Vegeta Saga which led to the two developing a strong bond with each other, he became a permanent member of the Dragon Team and eventually one of Earth's greatest heroes.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="box">
   <h4>Chi-Chi</h4>
   <p><em>Chi-Chi</em> is the princess of Fire Mountain and the daughter of the Ox-King. She later marries Goku and becomes the loving mother of Gohan and Goten. She was first introduced as a shy and fearful girl, but later, as she gets older, develops a very tomboyish, tough and fierce personality, which sometimes causes her to have angry outbursts seen several times throughout the series. Despite this, she has shown her love for Goku and their sons many times throughout the series</p>
  </div>
  <div class="box">
    <h4>Bulma</h4>
    <p><em>Bulma</em> is a brilliant scientist and the second daughter of Capsule Corporation's founder Dr. Brief and his wife Panchy, the younger sister of Tights, and is Goku's first friend. She used to be the girlfriend of Yamcha, but moved on (while remaining friends with him) and, eventually, became the wife of Vegeta, as well as the mother of Trunks and Bulla. While she is unable to physically fight most of the villains in the series, her gadgetry plays a key role in winning several battles as well as the search for the Dragon Balls. Bulma is the most significant female character in the series. Aside from Goku, Bulma is the single longest-running character in the entire meta-series, being introduced in the first Dragon Ball chapter and episode, and maintaining a prominent role until the end of the series.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="box">
    <h4>Krillin</h4>
    <p><em>Krillin</em>is a supporting protagonist in the Dragon Ball franchise. Krillin had a brief rivalry with Goku when they first met and trained under Master Roshi, but they quickly became lifelong best friends.[9] One of the most powerful and talented martial artists on Earth, Krillin is courageous, faithful, and good-natured. He is a prominent Z Fighter, despite usually being overpowered by the major enemies. His short stature and baldness (with the exception of when he grows out his hair in the Majin Buu Saga onwards, although he occasionally shaves his head in several sagas in Dragon Ball Super) aid him in his ability to provide comic relief during tense moments. During the latter half of Dragon Ball Z, he largely retires from fighting, opting to settle down with his family instead, becoming the husband of Android 18 and the father of Marron. However, he returns to his lifestyle as a warrior later on in Dragon Ball Super.</p>

    <h4>Master Roshi</h4>
    <p><em>Master Roshi</em>, also known as the Turtle Hermit and God of Martial Arts, is a master of martial arts, who trained Gohan, Ox-King, Goku, Krillin, and Yamcha. He has a sister named Fortuneteller Baba.</p>
